            <p>
                Pre-season is over and you know what that means, the regular season is right around the corner! Now we wait two whole weeks before meaningful football is back.
                Unfortunately, a lot can happen in two weeks. Players can win or lose team competitions and injuries can occur. If you're like me, you're going to spend the downtime
                consuming as much fantasy news as you can, bungle the draft, and then claw your way back to middle of the pack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I personally love Fantasy Football season. It brings me joy every year to stare at spreadsheets and crunch numbers while trying to find the next player
                poised for a breakout season. I personally started playing in 2016 with a single standard points league. I truly thought I would play for a single year and be done
                with the game. However, my love for fantasy now has me joining at least three leagues per year. I guess you could say it turned into quite a hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to thank you {{.}}, for taking time out of your day to not only read this, but also for playing fantasy with me. This is my first year ever
                running a league, especially one of this size. To say I am excited is an understatement. To compliment our weekly matches, I will be sending out this newsletter
                with weekly stats, standings, and musings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's have an amazing season this year.

                Alvin Kamara drafters. Taysom Hill will still be involved, but it sounds like NO will go for a more traditional passing attack rather than trusting their
                gadget QB with the offense. With Michael Thomas out with an injury for the first few weeks (and possibly more if there truly are issues between he and the front
                office), Alvin Kamara should see a significant bump.

                Do be careful with Ravens running backs in PPR leagues. Lamar Jackson has only thrown 40 times to a running back in his three years in the NFL. You have been warned.
